## 3. Root Cause Analysis

### 3.1 Creative Fatigue
Several creative messages (especially those repeating similar comfort-themed language) saw:
- CTR drop  
- Reduced purchase intent  
- Declining relevance score  

**Evidence from insights.json:**
- Low-CTR ads consistently share similar messaging  
- Creative message clusters show declining performance over time  

### 3.2 Audience Saturation
Rising frequency values indicate that the audience has been over-exposed.

**Indicators:**
- Frequency increasing from ~2.1 → ~3.0  
- CPM rising simultaneously (common indicator of ad fatigue)  

### 3.3 Reduced Ad Efficiency
Cost metrics show:
- CPC slightly increasing  
- Purchases decreasing  
- ROAS falling  

These are typical signs of:
- Creative repetition
- Weak message–audience alignment

## 4. Key Insights (From insights.json)

### 🔍 Insight 1: CTR Decline is the Primary Driver  
Several adsets show lower click engagement, causing fewer people to enter the purchase funnel.

Creative messages with themes like “Soft Comfort”, “Daily Wear Comfort”, and “All-Day Support” show reduced CTR and engagement.

### 🔍 Insight 3: Ad Frequency Increasing  
Audiences are being shown the same creative too many times → reducing effectiveness.
